# Here put all the aliases for the displayed paths
# example 1 :
# %HOME%/foo=bar
# will show "Current directory : bar/"
# instead of "Current directory : /home/<user>/foo/"
#
# Note that the aliases are applied in the order bellow, so don't put something like :
# /test = abc
# /test/foo = bar   <- here "/test" has already been renamed to "abc", you should use ~/foo=bar
# you can use any environment variable between two "%"

# changes the current folder at the time expdir got opened to '.'
# %PWD%=.

# changes the home folder to '~'
%HOME%=~
